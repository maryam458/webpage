# SPA To-Do Application

## Project Overview
This project is a simple **Single Page Application (SPA)** developed with **HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript**.  
The purpose is to demonstrate SPA behavior using client-side routing, state management, and dynamic updates â€” all running in the browser without server-side components.  

The application was created as part of a project to explore how **generative AI tools** can assist in developing interactive web applications.

- **Accessibility awareness**
  - Semantic HTML structure
